# Roof_Maker

Inkscape extension to help make roof pieces for 3D papercraft designs. It also designs the pieces for dormer windows of several types.
Installing:
Copy Roof_Maker.inx and Roof_Make.py into your Inkscape user extensions directory. Where is that? Open Inkscape and go to the System section of the Preferences menu (Edit --> Preferences --> System). You will find a User extensions item containing the path to your user extensions directory.
Usage:
See the file Roof_Maker_Usage.pdf for details on this extension and how to use it.
Note:
This extension (for Inkscape version 1.1.)  Please let me know if you find issues with it.  
This is a personal project that I’m sharing, and do not promise it to be bug-free.
